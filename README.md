# 3D Mesh Descriptor
Python project focussing on applications involving describing genus-0 meshes using spherical harmonics.  
Currently just a very basic initial implementation.

## Installation
python 3
packages:
 - trimesh
 - pyshtools
 - tkinter
 - rtree
 - pyglet

For rtree we also need:
https://libspatialindex.org/install.html (afterwards run ldconfig to make library findable)
